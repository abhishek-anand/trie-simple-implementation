==========================

A simple implementation of trie


 A Trie supporting the following operations for n words with lengths k
 Only words of small latin alphabets are supported. To modify it to
 work for other, you will have to map the child array indexes properly
 1. insert - O(k) 
 2. search - O(k)
 3. count of words with a given prefix of length k - O(k)
